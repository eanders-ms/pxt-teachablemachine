# Simulator Extension Sample

## What is a simulator extension?

A simulator extension (referred to as _simx_) is a static web application that complements a traditional MakeCode extension. When you add an extension containing a _simx_ to your MakeCode project, the simulator extension is loaded into a separate iframe within the MakeCode editor:

Simulator extensions are implemented as part of a standard MakeCode extension, but are organized as a separate project in a subfolder. This keeps them distinct from the main extensionâ€™s code.

## Creating a simulator extension

The easiest way to create a simulator extension is to fork this repository and then modify it to fit your needs.

See [./simx/README.md](./simx/README.md) for detailed instructions.
